This book has been developed in the open, and it wouldn't be nearly as good without your contributions.
There are a number of ways you can help make the book even better:

-   If you don't understand something, please [let me know](mailto:h.wickham@gmail.com).
    Your feedback on what is confusing or hard to understand is valuable.

-   If you spot a typo, feel free to edit the underlying page and send a pull request.
    If you've never done this before, the process is very easy:

    -   Click the edit this page on the sidebar.

    -   Make the changes using GitHub's in-page editor and save.

    -   Submit a pull request and include a brief description of your changes.
        "Fixing typos" is perfectly adequate.

    -   If you make significant changes, include the phrase "I assign the copyright of this contribution to Hadley Wickham" - I need this so I can publish the printed book.
