# Contributing

This book has been developed in the open, and it wouldn't be nearly as good 
without your contributions. There are a number of ways you can help make the
book even better:

* If you don't understand something, please 
  [let me know](mailto:h.wickham@gmail.com). Your feedback on what is confusing
  or hard to understand is valuable.

* If you spot a typo, feel free to edit the underlying page and send a pull 
  request. If you've never done this before, the process is very easy: 
  
    * Click the edit this page on the sidebar.
  
    * Make the changes using github's in-page editor and save.
    
    * Submit a pull request and include a brief description of your changes.
      "Fixing typos" is perfectly adequate.
      
    * If you make significant changes, include the phrase "I assign the 
      copyright of this contribution to Hadley Wickham" - I need this so I can 
      publish the printed book.
